# Project Management
## 1.1 Goals & Objectives
### Broad Goals
The broad environmental outcome we are working to achieve is encouraging users to take steps to continuously combat climate change through simple actions in their daily lives.
### UN SDG Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
- 13.3 Improve education, awareness-raising, and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.
- 13.3.1 Extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c)
teacher education; and (d) student assessment
### UN SDG Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development 
- 14.1 By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution
- 14.1.1 (a) Index of coastal eutrophication; and (b) plastic debris density
### UN SDG Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
- 17.17.1 Amount in United States dollars committed to public-private partnerships for infrastructure

**SMART Objectives**

*Specific* - As we work to structure the goals on the task list, we will conduct user research and build user profiles to ensure we target a particular 
category of users and demographics.

*Measurable* - Based on user engagement with the app and their interactions with the games, events, and quizzes, we can measure how many interact with the app, 
how much the users learn, and take action regarding climate change.

*Attainable* - Our team will set reasonable expectations and goals to maintain measurable progress and develop a clear understanding of our capabilities.

*Relevant* - Climate change has been a prevalent and increasingly significant issue as time moves forward so more people need to learn more about it and 
start to take action. Additionally, this project takes advantage of the increased use and availability of technology and the rising popularity of games to help solve this problem.

*Time-Bound* - Our team has until the end of the Spring Quarter to finish the project and achieve our goals. We will have weekly meetings to keep track of our progress.

## 1.2 Approach
**Design Approach**
- Our approach to this challenge is to learn about current user experience on how they view climate actions and research methods to make them engaging and fun.
- We will leverage Figma and Miro to centralize all the research, utilize Construct3 to develop the final product, and employ Agile project management to keep up with user feedback and criticism.

**Project Management Strategies**
- Project management will be conducted as outlined by the team contract. Conflicts, decisions, responsibilities, and meeting schedules are outlined to ensure the smooth completion of the design challenge. 

**User Research Methods**
- The user research methods that we will be employing are secondary research, market research, and interviews.
- Secondary research allows us to catch up with the current innovations and findings in the climate change industry.
- Market research helps us understand the current competition and trends along with the methods they use to either succeed or fail.
- Finally, interviews will be conducted to learn the wants and needs of our stakeholders listed in 1.5. Below are a few questions that we will ask them. 

| Proposed Research Participants | Means of Contact | Interview Questions |
| :---- | :----: | ---- |
| Instructor (Professor Ngo) | Email | Are you aware of any resources or research that could enhance our project?, Is there any feedback you have that could improve our app’s educational features?, In your research, what means of user engagement have you found most helpful in encouraging long-term retention? |
| App Users | Public Survey/Connections | What aspects of the app do you find to be the most engaging?, Do you believe our app has in any way influenced your awareness/opinions about climate change?, In what ways do you believe our app could improve?, Do you believe in climate change?, What do you already know about climate change?, What actions do you take in your daily life that you believe reduce the impact of climate change? |
| UCSD Green New Deal | Email | Are there any communities underrepresented and underserved that the Green New Deal believes we could potentially incorporate into our user research for the app?, In the past few years, efforts by the UCSD Green New Deal have resulted in a mandatory class being added to the UCSD education requirements. What do you believe to be the most important facet of climate change to address for students?, What are ways in which our app could better raise awareness about environmental justice movements? |
| Developer (Ron Kagan) | Email | What features/strategies have you used that increase user retention and app usage?, What features/strategies have you used that decreased user retention and app usage?, Why do you think people have a hard time either learning about climate change or doing actions that help reduce the impact of climate change? |
| SoCal Climate Groups | Email/Phone | Are there any ethical considerations that are important to remember when designing an app to prevent climate change? |
| Team Members | Discord/In-Class | What would be important to include in an educational app?, What are/would be the strengths and weaknesses of the app? |
